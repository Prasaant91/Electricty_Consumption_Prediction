**Time Series Forecasting Projects
**
This repository contains three complete machine learning projects designed to forecast electricity consumption from time series data collected at 30-minute intervals. The goal was to explore, compare, and understand different modeling approaches for time series forecasting:

LSTM (Deep Learning using recurrent neural networks)

TimeGPT (Zero-shot, large foundation model for time series)

XGBoost (Tree-based gradient boosting with exogenous features)

Each model has been implemented with a full pipeline from data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
